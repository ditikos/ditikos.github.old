I have set up this blog for my generic projects that I distribute on github. So far I've been working on wordpress as a freelance and inside contract jobs, Sometimes, I get into some mini projects after I get ideas from the facebook group of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/WordPressGreekCommunity/?ref=bookmarks" target="_new">Wordpress Greek Community</a>.
