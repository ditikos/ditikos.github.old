I have worked with wordpress for over two years. I know, this blog is not created in wordpress (mostly because github doesn't support it so far, I use jekyll here), but it's my favorite platform so far. Anyways, there was a need for a plugin to create math equations. Even though there are a handful on the wordpress plugin repository, I decided to make one, so that to try the codex functions of adding a plugin to the tinymce editor. The result is <a href="https://github.com/ditikos/equation2015" target="_new">equation2015</a>, a plugin that integrates codecogs equation editor (<a href="https://latex.codecogs.com/" target="_new">Here!</a>), a LaTeX compatible editor.
